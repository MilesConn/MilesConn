### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miles Conn (pronouns: he/his/him) and I'm a sophomore at Carnegie
Mellon University. 

I'm interested in a lot of things, currently I'm a full-stack developer at
[Convertsation.org] working with Vue, Golang, and some other neat
tools. 


I'm also working on a super secret *(ie still under double-blind review)* project based on [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) 
that I'm excited to show off once I can.
